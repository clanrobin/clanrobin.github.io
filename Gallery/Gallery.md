Here is a compilation of data visualization examples that I have generated as part of my research and work.

##Multi-Component Fitting and Data Slicing to reveal Milky Way Substructure

In this project we analyzed the entire 20,000 square degrees of the PanSTARRS-1 survey. This is an imaging survey of about 1/3 of the entire night sky. It includes all the Northern Hemisphere and a large portion of the Southern Hemisphere. We divided it into 4x4 degree blocks and generated stellar density profiles for each region as a function of distance. In simple terms, we are making an estimate of the number of stars in that direction per distance bin.

This can be seen as the data points in this first figure. Having obtained this, we can attempt the understand the distribution of the stars in that particular direction by fitting a model. In this case, the model describes different structural components of the Milky Way and the sum of the those components should match the data. By fitting them we can gain insights into the Milky Way itself.

Given that this data has around 20,000 lines-of-sight we can reconstruct an image of the night sky, as seen by this telescope where we select not only the distance we wish to probe, but also scale it to the stellar density at that distance. In this next figure, the footprint of each line-of-sight (pixel) is rendered to the exact shape it needs to be to fit into this Aitoff projection. The stellar densities are scaled to highlight the features. 

The Milky Way runs across the x-axis and is excised from the figure, so as not to obscure the faint stellar streams and overdensities in the Milky Way Halo. The large white portions at the edges of the map are the regions of sky that the telescope cannot see.

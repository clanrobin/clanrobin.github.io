# Matched Filter Analysis

Here I present work done by Deeksha Beniwal when she was my student as part of her Australian Gemini Undergraduate Summer Studentships (AGUSS) at Gemini South Observatory. The aim of her project with me was to develop a Matched Filter to draw out a low signal-to-noise structure that exists around a known Milky Way Globular Cluster. This technique has been very successul in discovering a multitude of faint stellar streams in the vicinity of the Milky Way.

## Scikit-learn
[scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org)

Let's start with the Scikit-learn routines, to be honest, I tried skimming ahead on these examples just so I could run some code but ended up, very quickly, having no idea what was going on. So let's try and pull all the pieces together.



## The Iris dataset: 
### [data and plots](]http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)
So this dataset is used to show primarily how Support Vector Machines are good at finding and identifying sub-groups within a given dataset. In this example, based on the properties of three different types of Irises, SVMs are able to find a robust way to determine which Iris is which.

So scikit-learn tries to teach us something about SVM's here, so let's have a look at what is going on.

## The digits dataset: 
### [data and examples](]http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#)
The other dataset is used to show how machine learning can help you classify something like handwritten numbers and identify which number you think it might be.

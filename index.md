## Stanford Stats Course
Stanford University has a self-paced statistics course run by Prof Trevor Hastie and Prof Robert Tibshirani.
The course covers: Overview of Statistical Learning, Linear Regression, Classification, Resampling Methods, Linear Model Selection and Regularization, Moving Beyond Linearity, Tree-Based Methods, Support Vector Machinesand  Unsupervised Learning.

## Scikit-learn
Here I explore the Iris dataset with Principal Component Analysis in Python.

## Astro Research
Here I use k-Nearest Neighbours to make a 2D photometric completeness map of an astronomical field, using Python and TOPCAT.

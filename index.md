### [data and plots](]http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)
So this dataset is used to show primarily how Support Vector Machines are good at finding and identifying sub-groups within a given dataset. In this example, based on the properties of three different types of Irises, SVM are able to find a robust way to determine which Iris is which.

So scikit-learn tries to teach us something about SVM's here, so let's have a look at what is going on.

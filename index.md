# Exploring Statistical Learning and Data Science
Here you can find my different tinkerings with a variety of statistical learning packages, along with some of my own astronomical research.

## Stanford Stats Course
Stanford University has a self-paced statistics course run by Prof Trevor Hastie and Prof Robert Tibshirani.
The course covers: Overview of Statistical Learning, Linear Regression, Classification, Resampling Methods, Linear Model Selection and Regularization, Moving Beyond Linearity, Tree-Based Methods, Support Vector Machinesand  Unsupervised Learning.

## Scikit-learn
Here I do some basic exploration of the Iris dataset with Principal Component Analysis in Python.
I went into a lot more depth on PCA in the Stats Course, link above.

## Astro Research
Latest research project implementing a [clustering](/Clustering/Pyggmis_Test.md) algorithm (pygmmis) to recover clusters within a field that includes noise and cropped distributions. 

Here I use [k-Nearest Neighbours](/astro/kNN_example.html) to make a 2D photometric completeness map of an astronomical field, using Python and TOPCAT.

[Matched Filter analysis](/MatchedFilter/MatchedFilter.md) of the Palomar 5 stellar stream. This analysis was done by Deeksha Beniwal when she was my student at Gemini South Observatory.

[Gallery](/Gallery/Gallery.md) documents some of data visualization projects I have done over the years. These include multi-component fitting, building composite data products by slicing and processing data, website structure visualization.

A blog post on [Comet 67P Observations](http://www.gemini.edu/blog/blog/2015/08/13/gemini-spots-rosetta-on-its-way-back-to-the-sun/) that I helped obtain observations for.
